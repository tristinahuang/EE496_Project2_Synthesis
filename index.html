								 <b>- Team rules</b><br>Here are some key things to keep in mind when communicating:
Be responsible first. The unity of words and deeds is very important. You need to be responsible for your words and deeds, and you will also be responsible for your words.
Second please be helpful.<br>
The third is to think carefully. Regardless of your intentions, your statements can be attributed to the company, and you should think carefully when making statements that may cause others to make false assumptions.
Finally, we must work hard to think about possible defects and loopholes, and take the initiative to complete the work in the gray area. For example, some overlapping work areas with colleagues should be resolved through cooperation rather than ignored.<br><br>
								 <b>- Team member expectations</b><br>We expect our team members are experienced working with 3D computer graphics concepts, a basic understanding of virtual reality concepts, experience working in different parts of the technology stack to complete a project – e.g. across front-end and back-end, PHP, React Native, and/or C++. Besides, our team members should have cross-group and cross-culture collaboration.<br><br>
								<b>- Areas of expertise and deficiencies</b><br>
								For our expertise, we’re focused on building otherworldly experiences that can be shared with anyone—from anywhere and can detect human health data. Our project is driving VR forward with breakthrough work in computer vision, advanced optics, eye tracking, mixed reality, and new ways to map the human body. Virtual reality’s potential is immense, and we’re just getting started. <br>

For deficiencies, we are still working hard to make our VR technology can truly make users feel “all-around”, with the limitation of our team’s size, this is still hard to improve the VR technology.<br><br>

								<b>- Team member role assignments</b><br>
								
								Team lead:<br>Lead the entire team and review the direction and actual progress of the product in a rolling manner.<br>
								Documentation lead:<br>Describe and assign specific product direction and division of labor<br>

			<h2 class="team__title">System Design</h2>
			<p class="team__descr" align="left">• Describe how you will implement various subsystems<br><br><br>

			Our virtual reality (VR) headset is a device used to provide assistance for three-dimensional (3D) simulation, computer games, and health detection applications (such as blood oxygen concentration detection, heart rhythm detection, etc.). Our VR headsets consist of organic light emitting diodes (OLED) or liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and head motion tracking sensors to provide effective 3D images. The sensor tracks head movement and provides 3D images with up to 360-degree field of view based on head movement.<br><br>

In image and data processing, we will use CNN model and GAN model to train our image generation.<br><br>

In addition, our VR heads can also be applied to the medical field to train students in surgical operations and other operations. In addition, we will also develop VR headsets with eye-tracking and motion tracking functions to increase the user’s virtual reality experience. In addition, our headsets will be able to use auxiliary hand devices to track hand movements. Similarly, there is eye technology to develop eye tracking functions.<br>

			<h2 class="contact__title">Test Plan</h2>
			<p class="portfolio__descr" align="left">

<b>Objectives</b><br>
Make sure the users’ vital signs including heart rate and breathing rate are measured accurately with acceptable deviations according to the system requirements. In addition, provide users with good immersive experiences with less motion sickness, vision impairment, and headaches.<br><br><br>
To achieve our objectives, the following approaches are included in the QA process:<br><br>

<b>User Specifications and Experience Testing</b><br>
Before any testing begins, QA engineers shall thoroughly review the VR headset scope requirements. After familiarizing themselves with the requirements, they prepare potential use cases in the shoes of the consumers, providing a holistic view of the product.<br><br>

<b>Real Device Testing</b><br>
Test on the specialized hardware devices provided by our partnerships. These might include headsets that connect to personal computers for a powerfully immersive VR experience and others that work with the user’s smartphone to create a more mobile VR experience.<br><br>
 
<b>Accessibility Testing</b><br>
Headaches, seizures, motion sickness, eye strain, and other bodily harm are a few of the worst-case scenarios that testers need to be on the lookout for. Though full immersion is the goal, it’s also vital to limit the discomfort of the user as much as possible.<br><br>

 <b>Compatibility Testing</b><br>
Rigorous compatibility testing helps ensure that product teams do not face any surprises when they go to market. Compatibility testing on smartphones and personal computers help measure the performance of the VR-headset-app when accessed by devices with lower system specifications, or on a device that it hasn’t been optimized for. It can also help catch dangerous non-functional issues, such as VR headsets overheating.<br><br>

<b>Examining the correctness of the measured data of vital signs</b><br>
Providing users with correct vital signs measurement is important. This gives users insight into their body condition and enables them to seek further medical assistance if needed. Therefore, engineers shall collaborate with health professionals in the QA process to get a better understanding of normal and abnormal vital signs measurement under different scenarios.<br>

			<h2 class="contact__title">Real World Constraints</h2>
			<p class="portfolio__descr" align="left">
				• Identify and provide solutions to positive/negative environmental effects of the project, if any <br><br>
<b>Positive environmental effects</b>
<br><br>
Firstly, Oaround VR headset enables users to experience nature at home, which may mitigate the negative impact produced by human activity. VR may also cut down on some major energy consumption and waste in certain ways. 
<br><br>
 
Secondly, it will enable more complex testing of a variety of initiatives and engineering projects, which can avoid the damage to the environment of field testing. It’s difficult to get into specifics in some areas, but the fight against environmental deterioration and climate change involves complex technological systems, large facilities, inventive engineering, and more than we probably can’t even imagine just yet. Building these things requires sophisticated planning, significant ingenuity, and trial and error – all of which can be aided by VR. The technology will in many cases give people the ability to test designs and visualize impact, solving problems and perfecting products, systems, and whatever else before building them and putting them into practice. In simpler terms, the side of the climate change fight involving inventions and engineering could get more precise, efficient, and effective.<br>
 
<b>Negative environmental effects</b>
<br><br>
 
Firstly, it’s about the volume of plastic required to make the Oaround VR headset. Most of the plastic used in technology and production is made from non-renewable fossil fuels. Further, the process of forming plastic from those fossil fuels is a major source of pollution as is the fuel used to run that process. 
 <br><br>
Secondly, Oaround VR headset contains elements including lenses, motion tracking technology, and circuitry. The circuitry, made of gold and other precious and rare metals, are some of the most environmentally damaging and unscrupulously obtained materials in technological devices.
<br><br><br>

• Identify and provide solutions to positive/negative ethical effects of the project, if any <br><br>
<b>Positive ethical effects:</b><br>
1. VR headset can serve as a great tool in education. VR provides students with various real-world experiences to broaden their horizons and ensures their safety. <br>
2. VR headset can help people to explore the world and exercise with lower cost.  
 <br><br>
<b>Negative ethical effects:</b><br>
1. Users may hurt without proper protection. <br>
2. Users may be isolated from society if they are consumed by Oaround VR headset. <br>
3. Pornographic content may be involved. <br>
In a realistic environment, excessive exposure to pornography could influence harmful behavior toward women. <br>
4. Crimes in virtual reality. <br>
Unlike playing video games, VR allows users to kill and rob in a form very similar to the real world. <br><br><br>


• Identify and provide solutions to safety concerns of the project, if any <br><br>
<b>1. Physical hurt</b><br>
Users may end up walking into walls or fail to recognize key dangers in their immediate surroundings. Therefore, real-time sensory feedback is necessary. For example, using a circular walking arc to simulate straight-line walking without ever walking past an intended boundary.
<br><br>
 
<b>2. Eyesight</b><br>
Visual perception in virtual environments may affect the growth of the eye, which can lead to myopia or nearsightedness. We can provide suggested use time for the devices.   
<br><br>
<b>3. Motion Sickness</b><br>
In real life, our eyes naturally converge and focus on a point in space, and our brain is so used to this that it’s coupled the two responses together. Virtual reality separates those, confusing the brain. We can provide suggested use time for the devices. And we can also advise users to breathe in fresh air to mitigate it. <br>
<br><br>
 
<b>4. Content for kids</b><br>
VR games or apps may involve some pornographic and violent scenes and experience. Children may be even more susceptible to confusing virtual reality with the real thing. We can set age restrictions for games and provide advice on parents participating.
<br><br>

• Can these above concerns/effects be avoided through more mindful choices during the design process of the product? If so, then how? <br>
YES.<br>
 1. We can use more environmentally friendly materials to design the VR headset. For example, using renewable resources like leather or wood.<br>
2. We can design the device with more precise sensor detection and control to avoid physical harm to users.<br>
3. Reduce pornography and violence in VR games.<br>
4. Set age restrictions for various VR games.
<br><br>

• What concerns might users have when using this product? <br>
1. Whether the VR headset can provide great visual and auditory experience.<br>
2. Whether it’s comfortable to wear. <br>
3. The quality of this product and return policy. <br>
4. The amount of VR games and apps to experience. <br>
5. The endurance of VR headset. <br>
6. The function of measuring heart rate and breathing rate.
